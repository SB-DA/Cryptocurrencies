# Cryptocurrencies
> Utilized unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze cryptocurrency data

## Overview
> Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, was interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, was lost in > the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they asked us to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create > a classification system for this new investment.
>
> The data we will be working with is not ideal, so we had to process it to fit the machine learning models. As there was no known output for what we needed, we decided to use > unsupervised learning. Clustering was chosen as the method of grouping the cryptocurrencies. In order to present the findings to the board, we used data visualization.
